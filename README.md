# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple number-guessing game implemented in JavaScript. The game generates a random number, and the player's objective is to guess that number correctly. The game provides feedback to the player after each guess, guiding them to find the correct number.

## How to Play

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure you have Node.js installed.

3. Install the required dependencies using the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install
4. Run the game using the following command:
   ```bash
    node index.js
5. You will be prompted to enter your guesses. The game will provide feedback after each guess, indicating whether your guess is correct, too high, or too low.
6. Keep guessing until you find the correct number!

## Code Structure
The game uses the inquirer library to capture user input and the chalk library to add colored output.

It generates a random number for the player to guess.

The code includes functions for taking user input, checking guesses, and providing feedback.

The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.

The code is structured to make use of async/await for input.

A counter keeps track of the number of guesses.

## Dependencies

### inquirer: For capturing user input.
### chalk: For adding colored output to the console.
